A Todo list to keep track of what you have to do.
This app is to organize your schedule. 
You can add a new Todo into the list, you can delete a Todo by hovering your mouse on the left side of the list and then press the trash bin.
Also, you can line-through a Todo when you have completed it in order to keep track what you have achieved as far and check what is still left.
